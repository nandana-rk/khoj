Difficulty in Tracking and Managing Missing Reports

Problem: Law enforcement agencies or organizations handling missing persons' cases might struggle with keeping track of reports, especially when they are not digital or integrated with centralized systems.

Solution: THIS platform digitizes missing persons' reports and centralizes them in a searchable, accessible format. It not only makes it easier for authorities and families to manage and search for reports but also increases transparency and accountability in the process.
